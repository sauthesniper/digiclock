#DIGICLOCK

``project description``

DIGICLOCK is a a clock that I have built in the summer of 2022.
The clock has 6 displays (7-segment LED displays) on a modular platform.
The main part of the code is defining and using a specific class 
for the module that we have created.
Such a class might be used on a 4000-series IC for driving a 7-segment display.
